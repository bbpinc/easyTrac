Thanks for install easyTrac!

Now you have a complete Trac environment ready-to-go on your machine :-)

easyTrac provides a complete deployment using a Nginx web server and uWSGI.
So, to get them running you will need to execute the following command:

$ ./bin/supervisord

and you will have a Nginx running (on 8080 port, by default) and a supervisor 
instance too (on 9000 port, by default).

How to create a trac project
============================
$ ./bin/trac-admin opt/trac/demo initenv demo sqlite:db/trac.db

How to create a svn repository
==============================
$ ./bin/svnadmin create opt/svn/demo


Congratulations! Now you can access to your Trac project at:

http://localhost:8080

Enjoy it!
